1. [How to code: Simple data](https://www.edx.org/learn/coding/university-of-british-columbia-how-to-code-simple-data)
   - This course teaches the first principles of how to design a program from a paper and pen to readable, reliable, scalable code.
   - Remarkable Projects
     - Pomodoro App
     - Space Invader
2. [How to code: Complex data](https://www.edx.org/learn/coding/university-of-british-columbia-how-to-code-complex-data)

   - This course explains computer science concepts such as abstraction, accumulators (context-prseving, result-so-far, to do accumulators), graphs, encapsulation, avoid re-compuations, etc...
   - The final project was to do the merge sort algorithm (A BEAUTIFUL ALGORITHM!)

3. [Programming Languages A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)

   - This course furhter explained more computer science while revisiting some again using the ML language (staticly typed language)
   - New concepts such as pattern matching, polymorphism, functions as first-class expressions, modules were addressed

4. [Programming Language B](https://coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b)

   - This course used the Racket language as an example of a dynamically-typed language to explain concepts such delayed expressions/thunks, streams, promises, macros, meomoization
   - The homework of the second week was designing an interpreter for a programming language called MUPL
     - This language had support for primitive types (int/aunit/closures)
     - It supports recursive functions, higher order functions and so more (possible because we handled functions as first-class expressions that evaluate to closures with environment included for lexical scoping)
     - It had the famous build-in function `map` for convenience

5. [Programming Language C](https://coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c)

   - Currently doing

6. [Calculus 1A: Differentitation](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.1x+2T2019/course/)
   - I have a good background on calculus, so I will just do the exercises
   - Currecly doing
