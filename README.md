1. [How to code: Simple data](https://www.edx.org/learn/coding/university-of-british-columbia-how-to-code-simple-data)
   - This course teaches the first principles of how to design a program from a paper and pen to readable, reliable, scalable code.
   - This course was the first to take, since I had previous knowledge in python. So I didn't take Python for everybody seriously
